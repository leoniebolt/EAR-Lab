# Comparison of four SLAM algorithms
In this project four SLAM algorithms were compared using a M2DGR dataset.
The dataset is found under

```bash
https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR.git
```

In this repository there are four branches with instructions on how to run these algorithms on your local PC.
