## Comparison of Four SLAM Algorithms

In this project, four SLAM algorithms are evaluated using the M2DGR dataset.

The dataset is available at:
```bash
https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR.git
```

The main branch of this repository contains three generic Python scripts. These scripts serve as templates and include placeholders for topic names and file paths. For each SLAM algorithm, the scripts are adapted accordingly and placed in the corresponding algorithm-specific branch.

The repository provides four separate branches, one for each SLAM algorithm. Each branch includes detailed instructions on how to run the respective algorithm locally.

# To evaluate a specific SLAM approach:

Switch to the corresponding branch.

Follow the instructions provided in that branch to run the algorithm on your local machine.
